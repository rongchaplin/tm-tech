## Business Requirements:
- A user can see all Notes in the Notes Page. Notes are ordered by the creation timestamp with
  the newest one at the top.
- A user can create a Note by clicking the Add Note button in the Notes Page. Clicking the Add
  Note button will open the Add Note Modal with the form to add the note.
- A Note has a title, description, creation date. A Note can also have multiple Tags.
- A user can see all tags in the Tags Page. The user can also add and delete Tags on this page.
- Tags only have a tag name.
- Tags can be shared across notes. Deleting a tag removes the tag from all associated notes.

## Technical Requirements:
- Create a single page app using a frontend framework (React, Angular, etc)
- Create REST services using a PHP framework
- Create optimized MySQL database tables (primary keys, foreign keys, etc)
- Please follow coding and database best practices
- For this test, create a public repository in Github or Bitbucket and push any code changes
  there. Weâ€™d like to see your commit history. Please provide the link to the repository when
  finished.
- Please provide instructions on how to run your app. Docker is preferred.

## Optional:
- Provide a way to filter the notes by tag in the notes list page
