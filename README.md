# Tokio Marine Tech Assessment  

## Docker Integration
Using a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) web framework, with full [HTTP/2](https://symfony.com/doc/current/weblink.html), HTTP/3 and HTTPS support.

Following the steps outlined in [Using Symfony Docker with an existing project](docs/existing-project.md) I have integrated 
the docker environment suggested by the [Symfony docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/docker.html)

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Run `docker-compose build --pull --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker-compose up` (the logs will be displayed in the current shell)
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `docker-compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
